In this assignment I used sklearn to do some machine learning of data leveraging two seperate Models.The models I choose was LogisticRegression and SVM. I used MinMaxscaler as part of the preprocessing of the data. I used GridSearch to then Tune the Model to attempt to increase my prediction result precentage to be as high as possible.

The results based on use these two model on the exoplanet data set is that the LogisticRegression model gave us a orginal percentage of 85% then when using GridSearch was able to increase that to 87.
The SVC gave me a orginal percentage of 82% and did not really increase when using the GridSearch. It also gave me alot of false positives. So in short I would recommend to use the LogisticRegression model for running machine learning on this dataset.
